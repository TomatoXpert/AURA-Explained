# AURA® — Adaptive Understanding & Rendering AI

Welcome to **AURA®**, the next evolution in real-time AI-powered rendering technology.

---

## What is AURA®?

**AURA®** (Adaptive Understanding & Rendering AI) is a revolutionary frame synthesis and upscaling system designed to deliver ultra-smooth, high-fidelity graphics at blistering frame rates.

Inspired by concepts like **NVIDIA®**’s DLSS, **AURA® goes far beyond** traditional super sampling or upscaling techniques by integrating advanced AI that *learns*, *remembers*, and *adapts* continuously — even during loading screens or menu navigation.

## How AURA Works

- **Continuous Learning:** Unlike prior methods, **AURA®** constantly learns how objects, NPCs, and environments move and behave in your game — storing this knowledge to generate smoother frames.
  
- **Frame Prediction & Synthesis:** AURA predicts future frames based on learned motion patterns and creates intermediate “fake” frames, boosting frame rates by 60 FPS, 120 FPS, or even 165 FPS.
  
- **Memory Persistence:** Even when you’re not actively playing (loading zones, menus, paused), **AURA®** keeps learning in the background, improving predictions over time.
  
- **Reward-Driven AI:** AURA uses a unique reward system to self-correct — gaining rewards for accurate frame predictions and penalizing errors to refine its output.

## Why Not Just Use DLSS®?

While **DLSS®** is a groundbreaking technology from **NVIDIA®**, **AURA® is not a copy** — it’s a next-generation system that builds on the concept of AI upscaling by adding:

- Persistent learning beyond single frames
- A self-improving reward mechanism
- Full scene and object motion understanding
- Prediction of frames *before* the player even looks at the action

**AURA® redefines what intelligent rendering can do.**
